## ->HTML Notes

- While **href** specifies the **destination** link, **target** specifies **where** the linked resource will be opened. If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the **_self** value which opens the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to **_blank**

- rel attribute: This attribute is used to describe the **relation** between the **current page** and the **linked document.**

- **noopener:** The noopener value of the rel attribute ensures that a **link opened** in a new tab or window **cannot interact** with or access the **original** page.

- **noreferrer:** The noreferrer value of the rel attribute provides both privacy and security. It prevents the **new page** from knowing **where the user came from** (hiding the referrer) and also **includes** the behavior of **noopener**, preventing the new page from accessing the original pag*.
*Adding the noreferrer value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it.*

- <img> element is a void element.
- void elements do not need a closing tag because they are naturally empty and do not contain any content.
